I'll create a React application that fetches data from the PokeAPI and allows users to search and filter through Pokémon. Let's build this step by step.

I've created a complete Pokémon Explorer application that meets all the requirements. Here's a breakdown of the implementation:

## Features Implemented

### 1. Data Fetching
- Fetches the first 150 Pokémon from the PokeAPI
- Displays each Pokémon in a card layout showing:
  - Name (capitalized)
  - Image (sprite)
  - Types (with color-coded badges)
  - ID number (formatted with leading zeros)

### 2. Search Functionality
- Real-time search input that filters Pokémon by name as you type
- Type filter dropdown to filter Pokémon by their elemental type
- Clear filters button that appears when filters are active
- Appropriate loading spinner and empty state messages

### 3. UI/UX
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Clean header with the application name
- Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, polished appearance
- Color-coded type badges that make identification easy

### Technical Implementation Details

- **React Hooks**: Used functional components with useState and useEffect hooks
- **Error Handling**: Implemented proper error states if the API fails
- **Loading States**: Shows a spinner while data is being fetched
- **Component Structure**:
  - Main `PokemonExplorer` component managing state and API calls
  - Reusable `PokemonCard` component for displaying individual Pokémon
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Handles "no results found" when filters return no matches
  - Manages API errors with proper error messages

## How to Deploy

To deploy this application:

1. Create a new React project using Create React App or Vite
2. Copy the code into your project
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install lucide-react
   ```
4. Deploy using a service like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages:
   - For Vercel/Netlify: Connect to your repository and follow their deployment steps
   - For GitHub Pages: Add the homepage field to package.json and use gh-pages package

## Additional Notes

- The application dynamically builds the type filter dropdown based on all available types in the fetched data
- The search is case-insensitive for better user experience
- Type badges are color-coded according to the Pokémon's type (fire is red, water is blue, etc.)
- The UI is designed to be clean and intuitive, following modern design principles
